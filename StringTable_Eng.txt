	*SB_STL01_0			"Scripted within an ancient tome, which lies beneath centuries of dust"
	*SB_STL01_1			"in the guarded library of Meckelon,"
	*SB_STL01_2			"is the story of how the Rift was formed."
	*SB_STL01_3			"Though most cannot recall a time when the Rift did not"
	*SB_STL01_4			"divide the Enclave and the Outlands, "
	*SB_STL01_5			"they were at one time, unified."
	*SB_STL01_6			"At that time, there were lands where the very essence of magic, "
	*SB_STL01_7			"was believed to dwell. For they were lush, and prosperous."
	*SB_STL01_8			"All who did not hold the secrets of the soil, "
	*SB_STL01_9			"which were protected by the Pact of Gi'Furo,"
	*SB_STL01_10			"coveted these lands fiercely."
	*SB_STL01_11			"The great demon Vatar was among these envious creatures, "
	*SB_STL01_12			"for he believed that with the magic of these lands in his grasp,"
	*SB_STL01_13			"he would surely become invincible."
	*SB_STL01_14			"And so, he lead his army to attack the dwellers of the land,"
	*SB_STL01_15			"and lay claim to it for himself! "
	*SB_STL01_16			"The battle raged on and on until at last the mighty wizard,"
	*SB_STL01_17			"Zale, stood alone against Vatar to protect the lands."
	*SB_STL01_18			"When all hope seemed lost and Vatar's victory imminent,"
	*SB_STL01_19			"Zale struck the final, fatal blow."
	*SB_STL01_20			"With a roar of anger and anguish, "
	*SB_STL01_21			"the wizard slammed his staff into the ground."
	*SB_STL01_22			"The world trembled and then parted beneath Vatar's feet."
	*SB_STL01_23			"A scream of outrage erupted from the demon's throat as he fell to his defeat."
	*SB_STL01_24			"However, victory did not come without a price."
	*SB_STL01_25			"The chasm that grew from this powerful blast of magic"
	*SB_STL01_26			"was too vast to be traversed,"
	*SB_STL01_27			"and the people were separated as much as the lands."
	*SB_STL01_28			"Those who had come to aid their brothers in fighting against the demon's army,"
	*SB_STL01_29			"returned to their home,called Meckelon, with stunned minds, and heavy hearts."
	*SB_STL01_30			"The pact of Gi'Furo had been broken,"
	*SB_STL01_31			"and they had become separated from their brothers."
	*SB_STL01_32			"The denizens of the outlands, a dark and selfish people,"
	*SB_STL01_33			"became known as the Dreg'atar"
	*SB_STL01_34			"And the enclave of magic land which had been divided from the rest,"
	*SB_STL01_35			"formed a peaceful city called Celenheim."
	*SB_STL01_36			"In time, all wounds are healed,"
	*SB_STL01_37			"for in the lengthy span since it was torn asunder,"
	*SB_STL01_38			"it seems that the magic inherent within the World"
	*SB_STL01_39			"has begun to knit the land back together."
	*SB_STL01_40			"The Rift grows smaller and can even be crossed in certain locations."
	*SB_STL01_41			"Though it should be a time of celebration and rejoicing, such is not the case."
	*SB_STL01_42			"For despite the passage of time,"
	*SB_STL01_43			"the greedy Dreg'atar still lust after the lands of magic."
	*SB_STL01_44			"Raid after raid has been sent into the enclave, in hopes of weakening it,"
	*SB_STL01_45			"for the major attack they intend to wage as soon as they are able."
	*SB_STL01_46			"Crops burned and possessions stolen,"
	*SB_STL01_47			"Celenhein has been thrown into a state of extreme unrest."
	*SB_STL01_48			"Heavy taxes are levied upon the people to help pay for the city's defense."
	*SB_STL01_49			"This has seen to the uprising of internal rebellions within the enclave."
	*SB_STL01_50			"And some of its inhabitants have landed in jail, along with the true enemy."
	*SB_STL01_51			"And it is here that our story begins."
	*SB_STL01_52			"A few rebellious grains of sand within the ever-turning hourglass of life..."

	*SB_STL02_0			"They had won the battle against the Outland raiders,"
	*SB_STL02_1			"and driven them from Celenheim's soil."
	*SB_STL02_2			"And victory was sweet upon their tongues"
	*SB_STL02_3			"as they set out upon the perilous journey before them."
	*SB_STL02_4			"This was their chance to redeem themselves and aid their people."
	*SB_STL02_5			"But so many things were unknown, unexplained."
	*SB_STL02_6			"Who were these Ancestors that Marcus spoke of?"
	*SB_STL02_7			"Why had Queen Aylindel not sent for them before now?"
	*SB_STL02_8			"Without time to confer with the Queen, they began."
	*SB_STL02_9			"They would have to cross the vast expanse of the dreaded Outlands"
	*SB_STL02_10			"and find these mysterious people who might be able to help."
	*SB_STL02_11			"Yet, not even Marcus seemed certain that the Ancestors still existed,"
	*SB_STL02_12			"or how they would receive visitors if they did."
	*SB_STL02_13			"As the sun descended, they came to the Divided City."
	*SB_STL02_14			"Once magnificent and proud, the Rift had reduced it to"
	*SB_STL02_15			"nothing more than crumbled buildings and jagged rooftops."
	*SB_STL02_16			"Now, as one of the only places where it is possible to cross the Rift,"
	*SB_STL02_17			"dark and twisted shapes await those who wish to traverse it."

	*SB_STL03_0			"Though the Ancestors acclaimed them as heroes after showing such"
	*SB_STL03_1			"valour and bravery in the defence against the Outland invasion,"
	*SB_STL03_2			"something seemed oddly amiss."
	*SB_STL03_3			"The Ancestors had been estranged from their brothers in Celenheim"
	*SB_STL03_4			"longer than anyone could remember, yet very little negotiation"
	*SB_STL03_5			"was needed for them to accept the perilous request"
	*SB_STL03_6			"to send aid against the hordes of Dreg'atar."
	*SB_STL03_7			"The eager offer to assist their brothers came at only one request."
	*SB_STL03_8			"Destroy the Fortress of Kam-Zara."
	*SB_STL03_9			"The Pact of Gi'furo forbid such destruction, but the Ancestors explained"
	*SB_STL03_10			"that it was their only hope of reaching the battle in time."
	*SB_STL03_11			"For the pass of Kam-zara, held tightly by the enemy,"
	*SB_STL03_12			"was the only obstacle in the fastest route to Celenheim."
	*SB_STL03_13			"Being a narrow path, Kam-Zara was easily defended."
	*SB_STL03_14			"It allowed very few men to keep an entire army at bay if need be,"
	*SB_STL03_15			"and it would be far too difficult if it were not destroyed."
	*SB_STL03_16			"Desperate times called for desperate measures."
	*SB_STL03_17			"The legendary High Wizard Zale was their last hope."
	*SB_STL03_18			"Known as the scourge of Vatar, the bane of Zurana,"
	*SB_STL03_19			"the man who severed the world, Zale must be found."
	*SB_STL03_20			"But if he still lived, and they were able to find him,"
	*SB_STL03_21			"would he help them? And what cost would"
	*SB_STL03_22			"the world pay this time for its salvation from evil?"

	*SB_STL04_0			"The smoke rose high into the sky"
	*SB_STL04_1			"blotting out the sun with its ink-like message."
	*SB_STL04_2			"Kam-Zara's fortress was no more."
	*SB_STL04_3			"This signal could be seen for miles, it would alert the Ancestors"
	*SB_STL04_4			"and the Outlanders alike."
	*SB_STL04_5			"Wearily they began to make their way back toward Celenheim."
	*SB_STL04_6			"Tension was high, for they knew they had helped in"
	*SB_STL04_7			"breaking the great Pact of Gi'furo once more."
	*SB_STL04_8			"And they had not had a chance to speak to the Queen "
	*SB_STL04_9			"before they departed on this journey."
	*SB_STL04_10			"Would they be hailed as heroes for bringing aid?"
	*SB_STL04_11			"Or would they be sent to the gallows for their horrific deed?"
	*SB_STL04_12			"Rumours of Mordessa's vast armies turned out to be quite accurate"
	*SB_STL04_13			"Day and night, the travelers were forced to hide among rocks and crevices"
	*SB_STL04_14			"while troop after troop of nightmarish creatures would pass them by."
	*SB_STL04_15			"The massive, twisted beasts and demons"
	*SB_STL04_16			"were a clear sign that the Underworld itself was massing for battle."
	*SB_STL04_17			"The ancient name of the mighty demon Vatar"
	*SB_STL04_18			"was often heard uttered among them reverently."
	*SB_STL04_19			"The travelers knew there was very little time left indeed"
	*SB_STL04_20			"At last, Castle Celenheim was in view."
	*SB_STL04_21			"But they would soon face their greatest challenge yet."

	*SB_STL05_0			"The battle had begun"
	*SB_STL05_1			"Vastly outnumbered, the armies of Celenheim were constantly"
	*SB_STL05_2			"in retreat towards the castle itself."
	*SB_STL05_3			"Vatar's hordes crossed the rift, smashed through"
	*SB_STL05_4			"the defenses and pursued them. It seemed hopeless."
	*SB_STL05_5			"But the death of the ancient demon came as a miracle."
	*SB_STL05_6			"Echoing through the mountains, and out over the fields,"
	*SB_STL05_7			"the sound of his final agony reached the ears of "
	*SB_STL05_8			"Enclavers and Outlanders alike."
	*SB_STL05_9			"The Outlanders froze in their tracks, eyes widened in horror."
	*SB_STL05_10			"It could not be. Vatar was undefeatable!"
	*SB_STL05_11			"Only moments later, the first of the Meckelon troops arrived,"
	*SB_STL05_12			"in a cloud of dust and banners over the horizon."
	*SB_STL05_13			"Mercilessly, they smashed into the confused Dreg'atar horde."
	*SB_STL05_14			"With a new boost of morale, "
	*SB_STL05_15			"the soldiers of Celenheim cried out their allegiance"
	*SB_STL05_16			"to their queen, and valiantly took up arms once more."
	*SB_STL05_17			"Without their leader, and surrounded, Vatar's horde"
	*SB_STL05_18			"was quickly diminished and soon, annihilated."
	*SB_STL05_19			"History would not be allowed to repeat itself."
	*SB_STL05_20			"As the chaos of battle gradually faded into silence,"
	*SB_STL05_21			"the small party of adventurers returned to Celenheim,"
	*SB_STL05_22			"soon to be celebrated as heroes."
	*SB_STL05_23			"As Queen Aylindel, Princess Jasindra and the Assembly of Six"
	*SB_STL05_24			"were praising them for their valiant efforts, "
	*SB_STL05_25			"Alecto of Meckelon stepped into the chamber, unannounced."
	*SB_STL05_26			"Boldly, he asserted his authority as the savior of the Enclave."
	*SB_STL05_27			"Angered by such arrogance, the Queen and her council"
	*SB_STL05_28			"were quick to voice their protests,"
	*SB_STL05_29			"and soon, they seemed to be on the brink of a new war."
	*SB_STL05_30			"High Wizard Zale himself stepped in."
	*SB_STL05_31			"Had there not been enough fighting?"
	*SB_STL05_32			"They had both broken the Pact of Gi'Furo to help their kinsmen."
	*SB_STL05_33			"Wearily, he urged them to come to peace."
	*SB_STL05_34			"But Alecto refused. Breaking the pact would no longer be tolerated!"
	*SB_STL05_35			"He declared that he would conquer the Outlands"
	*SB_STL05_36			"and try to restore the magic to them."
	*SB_STL05_37			"And the people of Celenheim would learn "
	*SB_STL05_38			"their place as infidels for their past sins."
	*SB_STL05_39			"Would the people of Meckelon succeed"
	*SB_STL05_40			"in conquering the remaining Dreg'atar,"
	*SB_STL05_41			"and restore magic and peace to the soil,"
	*SB_STL05_42			"or would they become like the enemy that had just been defeated?"
	*SB_STL05_43			"Only time would tell."
	*SB_STL05_44			"But that is another story, to be told another time."

	*SB_STD01_0			"Scripted within an ancient tome, which lies hidden beneath centuries of dust"
	*SB_STD01_1			"in the guarded library of Meckelon,"
	*SB_STD01_2			"is the story of how the Rift was formed."
	*SB_STD01_3			"Though most cannot recall a time when the Rift did not divide"
	*SB_STD01_4			"the enclave from the outlands,"
	*SB_STD01_5			"they were at one time, unified."
	*SB_STD01_6			"In that time, there were lands which were believed"
	*SB_STD01_7			"to bear the very essence of magic,"
	*SB_STD01_8			"for they were lush and prosperous."
	*SB_STD01_9			"All who did not hold the secrets of the soil, which were protected"
	*SB_STD01_10			"by the Pact of Gi'Furo, coveted these lands fiercely."
	*SB_STD01_11			"The great demon Vatar knew that with this magic, he would be invincible."
	*SB_STD01_12			"He would at last prevail over all! "
	*SB_STD01_13			"Venomously he led his army to attack the dwellers of the land"
	*SB_STD01_14			"to claim it as his own."
	*SB_STD01_15			"The battle raged and the people fell before Vatar's vast army."
	*SB_STD01_16			"Victory was so close it could be tasted upon their blackened tongues,"
	*SB_STD01_17			"as bodies of the defenders lay sprawled about them on the bloodied field. "
	*SB_STD01_18			"Exultantly, Vatar rose to proclaim his triumph!"
	*SB_STD01_19			"It was then that disaster struck, in the form of a pathetic little wizard"
	*SB_STD01_20			"called the Mighty Zale"
	*SB_STD01_21			"With a roar of anger and anguish,"
	*SB_STD01_22			"the wizard slammed his staff into the ground."
	*SB_STD01_23			"The world trembled and then cracked, parting beneath Vatar's feet."
	*SB_STD01_24			"With an outraged scream, the demon lord plummeted to the depths"
	*SB_STD01_25			"to be consumed by the earth he sought to rule"
	*SB_STD01_26			"A chasm grew from this powerful blast of magic,"
	*SB_STD01_27			"wide and longer than any could measure. "
	*SB_STD01_28			"It was too vast to be traversed,"
	*SB_STD01_29			"thus separating the people who fought against Vatar forever. "
	*SB_STD01_30			"The devastation on the faces of the defenders  was a small consolation"
	*SB_STD01_31			"to the Dreg'atar as they retreated to pray for Vatar's return."
	*SB_STD01_32			"It is said that time heals wounds and perhaps it is true,"
	*SB_STD01_33			"for in the centuries since it was torn asunder,"
	*SB_STD01_34			"it appears that magic began to knit the land back together."
	*SB_STD01_35			"The Rift has grown smaller and can even be crossed in certain locations."
	*SB_STD01_36			"Dreg'atar, driven by an ages old lust "
	*SB_STD01_37			"for the land that should belong to them,"
	*SB_STD01_38			"are now raising their hordes, building siege weapons,"
	*SB_STD01_39			"and preparing for the day when they may take their revenge"
	*SB_STD01_40			"and possession of the magic lands. "
	*SB_STD01_41			"On the other side of the Rift, "
	*SB_STD01_42			"the people of Celenheim are strengthening their defenses. "
	*SB_STD01_43			"They know another war will soon be waged against them."
	*SB_STD01_44			"While the armies are being gathered along the border of the Rift,"
	*SB_STD01_45			"the Head Counselor of Ark Moor, Mordessa,"
	*SB_STD01_46			"is making further preparations. "
	*SB_STD01_47			"Volunteers are being brought to her for special tasks,"
	*SB_STD01_48			"and there are rumors about an ancient force about to be awakened,"
	*SB_STD01_49			"one that has been slumbering for hundreds of years. "
	*SB_STD01_50			"And it is here that our story begins."
	*SB_STD01_51			"Violently shaken from their sleep,"
	*SB_STD01_52			"the chosen are taken by hooded figures to an unknown fate."

	*SB_STD02_0			"Ah yes. Perhaps these few would prove themselves"
	*SB_STD02_1			"to be an asset to the High Counselor."
	*SB_STD02_2			"The ambitious adventurers might serve her well,"
	*SB_STD02_3			"as long as their leash was held firmly, of course."
	*SB_STD02_4			"As reward for their achievements,"
	*SB_STD02_5			"a far more difficult and important task would be placed before them."
	*SB_STD02_6			"The information Mordessa would allow them would be limited,"
	*SB_STD02_7			"for they need  to do what they are told."
	*SB_STD02_8			"Stepping through the dark portal into her chambers was rarely"
	*SB_STD02_9			"enlightening, yet they would learn more than they had expected."

	*SB_STD03_0			"The massive form of Vatar dwarfed anything else "
	*SB_STD03_1			"they had ever encountered."
	*SB_STD03_2			"His presence was terrifying,"
	*SB_STD03_3			"for he was essence of power and evil incarnate."
	*SB_STD03_4			"Princess Jasindra screamed and squirmed with all her might,"
	*SB_STD03_5			"but there was no one left to save her from her fate."
	*SB_STD03_6			"She was devoured, and thus, Vatar was bound to Mordessa, his servant"
	*SB_STD03_7			"There was no doubt that he would seize upon her first mistake,"
	*SB_STD03_8			"break the bond and claim the world as his own."
	*SB_STD03_9			"But now, he was to command Mordessa's armies,"
	*SB_STD03_10			"cross the rift and crush the people of Celenheim once and for all."
	*SB_STD03_11			"There would be no one to stop him this time. "
	*SB_STD03_12			"The servant adventurers were given yet another task of importance,"
	*SB_STD03_13			"to assist in destroying as many strongholds "
	*SB_STD03_14			"of the Enclave along the rift as possible,"
	*SB_STD03_15			"in preparation for the glorious invasion!"
	*SB_STD03_16			"As they set out to do their bidding, "
	*SB_STD03_17			"Mordessa studied the retreating forms."
	*SB_STD03_18			"They had served her well. But now, since she had Vatar,"
	*SB_STD03_19			"they were expendable. "
	*SB_STD03_20			"Vatar's twisted form watched them as well,"
	*SB_STD03_21			"but for completely different reasons,"
	*SB_STD03_22			"hidden well beneath his visage of death and terror."

	*SB_STD04_0			"What is more glorious than serving the great demon Vatar himself?"
	*SB_STD04_1			"Not even the Mistress Mordessa could rival the offered power"
	*SB_STD04_2			"and prestige that would come from being"
	*SB_STD04_3			"chosen personally by His Eminence!"
	*SB_STD04_4			"Their rewards would be immeasurable"
	*SB_STD04_5			"if they helped free him from her trap."
	*SB_STD04_6			"And the punishment if they did not,"
	*SB_STD04_7			"would surely make death pale in comparison."
	*SB_STD04_8			"Demonstrating his immense power,"
	*SB_STD04_9			"Vatar effortlessly summoned a portal,"
	*SB_STD04_10			"which would take them to Ur-Annon Island, Mordessa's personal lair."
	*SB_STD04_11			"Icy winds howled from the ocean, and whistled over the small island, "
	*SB_STD04_12			"barren and lifeless."
	*SB_STD04_13			"The only evidence of inhabitance was the crude structure"
	*SB_STD04_14			"perched threateningly upon the hilltop"
	*SB_STD04_15			"Here, they would forsake their mistress for a new master."
	*SB_STD04_16			"Death, and worse, lurked ominously within every surrounding shadow."

	*SB_STD05_0			"At last the wretched little Queen and her bothersome assembly"
	*SB_STD05_1			"fell to their destined defeat!"
	*SB_STD05_2			"And Vatar watched as a stunned silence fell over Celenheim, "
	*SB_STD05_3			"for all could feel the loss of their beloved leader."
	*SB_STD05_4			"She who wielded the magic that nourished Celenheim was dead."
	*SB_STD05_5			"Her only heir was dead. Their fate was sealed."
	*SB_STD05_6			"With renewed vigour born of desperate men with nothing left to lose,"
	*SB_STD05_7			"the defenders continued their fight against the invading army,"
	*SB_STD05_8			"but to no avail. The hordes of Dreg'atar engulfed and devoured them."
	*SB_STD05_9			"Most were put to gruesome, painful deaths. "
	*SB_STD05_10			"No honour was spared, no kindness shown. "
	*SB_STD05_11			"The insignificant beasts who used to be known as"
	*SB_STD05_12			"Celenheim's proud and valiant guardians were now"
	*SB_STD05_13			"led through the streets in shackles, chained as slaves."
	*SB_STD05_14			"With great satisfaction, Vatar stood upon the mountaintop,"
	*SB_STD05_15			"watching the prisoners being herded away like dogs."
	*SB_STD05_16			"Yet, a sense of unease was beginning to creep over him."
	*SB_STD05_17			"Turning, the Mighty Demon looked down to see a mass of red and gold,"
	*SB_STD05_18			"advancing toward the trampled battlefield."
	*SB_STD05_19			"They were obviously intent on attacking, probably expecting"
	*SB_STD05_20			"that his troops were already weary from the war they had just won."
	*SB_STD05_21			"But such blatant arrogance from these mortals,"
	*SB_STD05_22			"who thought themselves greater than he, could not be tolerated!"
	*SB_STD05_23			"Angrily he rose to call his army once more to war. "
	*SB_STD05_24			"But that is another story, to be told another time."
