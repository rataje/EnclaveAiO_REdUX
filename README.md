# EnclaveRegistry
Registry Files for Enclave PC (2003) - Different branches allow for modding in different ways

At the moment this does not contain any model, texture, animation, gui, sound, level, and any other game file. 
This is simply a registry of references to these files and drives how many of them work in the game engine. 
Please purchase the game and support the developers.


**[WIP] Unlocker Source (available on moddb)**

**What This Does:**
- This mod tries to unlock everything right at the beginning. Weapons, Characters, Misc items. Also adds several entirely new characters, weapons, staffs, misc items.
It will open some new possibilities like playing the first map of Light campaign with every character. Additional all characters will be playable on opponent side.
I will try to expand it's features and ideas in future.


This is the branch which has been forked from a shared standalone mod here on gitHub.
