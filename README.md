# EnclaveRegistry
Registry Files for Enclave PC (2003) - Different branches allow for modding in different ways

At the moment this does not contain any model, texture, animation, gui, sound, level, and any other game file. 
This is simply a registry of references to these files and drives how many of them work in the game engine.
